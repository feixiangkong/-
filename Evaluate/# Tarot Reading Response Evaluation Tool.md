# Tarot Reading Response Evaluation Tool Documentation

## Introduction
This Python tool is designed to evaluate the quality of Tarot reading responses in Chinese, focusing on aspects such as accuracy, consistency, and fluency. It employs natural language processing techniques for analysis and scoring, making it a useful tool for assessing generated responses for Tarot readings or similar textual content.

## Functional Components

### 1. Accuracy Evaluation
- **Principle**: Checks whether the response contains predefined keywords.
- **Methodology**: Employs simple string matching to determine the presence of specific keywords in the responses. Each keyword appearance contributes a fixed score (0.2 points per keyword).
- **Application**: For each response, the number of keywords included is counted and converted into an accuracy score.

### 2. Consistency Evaluation
- **Principle**: Measures the semantic similarity between the question and the response.
- **Methodology**: Utilizes TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and Cosine Similarity. The process involves segmenting the text into words using Chinese word segmentation, calculating TF-IDF values, and then assessing similarity between question and answer using cosine similarity.
- **Application**: The similarity score obtained is multiplied by 0.2 to serve as the score for consistency.

### 3. Fluency Evaluation
- **Principle**: Assesses the readability and naturalness of the text.
- **Methodology**: Based on lexical diversity and sentence length. Lexical diversity refers to the proportion of unique words in the text. Sentence length is assessed based on a reasonable range of sentence lengths.
- **Application**: The text is segmented into words, and each sentence’s fluency is evaluated, followed by calculating the average fluency score for the entire text.

### 4. Comprehensive Evaluation
- **Principle**: Combines the scores from the above three aspects to derive an overall score.
- **Methodology**: For each response, calculates scores for accuracy, consistency, and fluency, and then averages these scores across all responses to obtain a comprehensive score.
- **Application**: Applicable for evaluating multiple responses to a question, providing an overall assessment of the model’s performance.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Input**:
   - Question (`question`): The Tarot reading question to be evaluated.
   - Keywords (`keywords`): A list of keywords related to the question.
   - Responses (`answers`): A set of responses to the question.

2. **Output**:
   - Scores for accuracy, consistency, and fluency for each response.
   - The overall average score for all responses.

3. **Execution**: Invoke the `evaluate_tarot_reading` function with the relevant input parameters.

## Applicability
This tool is suitable for evaluating the quality of responses generated by machine learning models for Tarot readings or automatically generated content. By considering accuracy, consistency, and fluency comprehensively, it offers a more holistic understanding of a model's performance in generating Tarot reading responses.

Note that while the scoring methods employed by this tool have a rational basis, they might not cover all aspects of evaluation comprehensively. In practical applications, expert human evaluation might be necessary to complement these automated scores.
